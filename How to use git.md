##Source : Udacity : Version control with Git

### First Time Git Configuration
Before you can start using Git, you need to configure it. Run each of the following lines on the command line to make sure everything is set up.


#### sets up Git with your name
```
git config --global user.name "<Your-Full-Name>"
```

#### sets up Git with your email
```
git config --global user.email "<your-email-address>"
```

#### makes sure that Git output is colored
```
git config --global color.ui auto
```

#### displays the original state in a conflict
```
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
```

```
git config --list
```

### Git code editor setup

#### Sublime Text Setup
```
git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text.exe' -n -w"
```

### To create a repo from scratch

#### Create a directory 
```
mkdir -p udacity-git-course/new-git-project && cd $_
```

#### Git init
The init subcommand is short for "initialize" - does the initial setup of a repository.
Here's a brief synopsis on each of the items in the .git directory:
1. config file - where all project specific configuration settings are stored.

From the Git Book:
Git looks for configuration values in the configuration file in the Git directory (.git/config) of whatever repository youâ€™re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository.
For example, let's say you set that the global configuration for Git uses your personal email address. If you want your work email to be used for a specific project rather than your personal email, that change would be added to this file.

2. description file - this file is only used by the GitWeb program, so we can ignore it
3. hooks directory - this is where we could place client-side or server-side scripts that we can use to hook into Git's different lifecycle events
4. info directory - contains the global excludes file
5. objects directory - this directory will store all of the commits we make
6. refs directory - this directory holds pointers to commits (basically the "branches" and "tags")

#### Git clone - to create an identical copy
```
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project
```

#### Git status
The git status command will display the current status of the repository.
```
$ git status
```

#### Git log
The git log command is used to display all of the commits of a repository.
```
$ git log
```
By default, this command displays:
the SHA
the author
the date
and the message

#### git log --oneline 
The --oneline flag is used to alter how git log displays information:
```
$ git log --oneline
```

This command:
lists one commit per line
shows the first 7 characters of the commit's SHA
shows the commit's message

#### git log --stat 
The --stat flag is used to alter how git log displays information:
```
$ git log --stat
```

This command:
displays the file(s) that have been modified
displays the number of lines that have been added/removed
displays a summary line with the total number of modified files and lines that have been added/removed

#### git log -p
The -p flag (which is the same as the --patch flag) is used to alter how git log displays information:
```
$ git log -p
```
This command adds the following to the default output:

displays the files that have been modified
displays the location of the lines that have been added/removed
displays the actual changes that have been made
